  <p>TracShield is the industry’s leading wayside top of rail friction management system. It senses the passing of train wheels over the TracShield’s durable sensors and automatically dispenses a controlled amount of friction modifier to the top of the rail.

TracShield wayside system is designed for:

Precision—applies the precise amount of friction modifier
Consistency—features a positive displacement pump that consistently applies the correct amount of friction modifier to the bar applicator at any temperature
Functionality—dispenses a wide range of friction modifiers
Reliability—designed with a concentrated effort on ease of maintenance and requires very little maintenance
The TracShield's bar applicator consists of only three components that are built to last and easy to maintain in the field. With a patented spring or air spring loaded design, the bar applicator resists damage from hi-rail trucks or hollow worn wheels. Loram’s top of rail bar applicators are compatible with any industry standard top of rail friction management system and friction modifier.

TracShield keeps you in the know. Sensors capture the condition of the system at all times and monitor friction modifier level, rainfall, door status, battery charge, temperature, and more. To reduce the amount of top of rail units needed, Loram’s TracShield utilizes a single digital controller that is capable of controlling the output for two separate tracks.

Loram offers three different sized TracShield application systems that provide options to select whether a smaller footprint, a large capacity tank, or a combination of those two is the most important feature.

  The productive, single solution for lifting and undercutting
The Loram Track Lifter Undercutter (TLU) offers industry-leading waste-only undercutting. The Loram TLU is built upon the same platform as the Loram Track Lifter and UC1200, and it can perform simple track lifting waste-only undercutting.

Along with greater speed, the Loram TLU offers a more productive and cost-effective solution compared to conventional undercutting services. The Loram TLU requires only a tamper and regulator, which vastly reduces the typical amount of support equipment required for waste-only undercutting. Unlike chain undercutters, the TLU does not need an excavator to remove ties or ballast in order to cut in. Loram’s patented, twin rotary undercutting wheels allow the TLU to quickly cut in and cut out. This feature is beneficial while performing any type of undercutting, but is extremely productive while undercutting multiple mud spots in a day.
